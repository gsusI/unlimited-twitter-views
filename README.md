## What does it do?

Unlimited Twitter Views works silently in the background, removing the barriers imposed by Twitter that limit the number
of tweets you can see each day. With this extension, you can enjoy an unlimited browsing experience on Twitter,
exploring as many tweets as you like without any restrictions.

## How Does It Work?

The extension instructs Chrome to block any attempts made by twitter to track which tweets are being displayed in your
screen, effectively bypassing the viewing limit. This ensures that you remain in total control and are not compromising
your privacy or security in any way.

## Features

- Unlocks unlimited viewing of tweets.
- No user data is collected or stored.
- Open-source and completely free to use.

## How to use it?

After installing the extension, it will automatically start working. There's no configuration or setup needed. When you
visit Twitter, the extension will bypass the tweet viewing limit, giving you unrestricted access to your Twitter feed.

## Is it safe?

Absolutely! Your privacy is our priority. Unlimited Twitter Views only interacts with specific network requests related
to the tweet limit functionality on Twitter. It does not collect, store, or transmit any data. The extension is fully
compliant with all developer program policies, including data usage policies.
